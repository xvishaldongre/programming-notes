# Chapter 5 - Programming Language

If you don't know the programming language is awkward, please read the first chapter. The following introduction is just a little bit of water. If you want to know more about it, please use Google or Wikipedia. Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages and applicable fields. Can not be generalized.

## C

The history of the C language has been initially mentioned in Chapter 4. C language is a general-purpose, procedural programming language widely used in the development of systems and application software. It is characterized by high efficiency, flexibility, rich functions, strong expressiveness and high portability. It is precisely because of these characteristics that it has been widely used in the embedded field.

The C language was developed and refined on the basis of the B language developed by Ken Thompson in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie, the developer of UNIX. Currently, C compilers are ubiquitous in a variety of operating systems, such as UNIX, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. The design of the C language has influenced many later programming languages, such as C++, Java, Golang, and C#.

In the course of development, there have been many slightly different versions of the C language. In 1989, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a set of ANSI standards for the C language, the so-called C89. After 10 years of development, the C99 standard was promulgated on the basis of C89. About ten years later, in December 2011, ISO officially announced the new international standard for C language: ISO/IEC 9899:2011. Most compilers currently support C99, or they can be specified for C89.

## C++

The relationship between C++ and C is unusual. In 1979, when Cjarne Stroustrup worked at the Murray Hill Laboratory in New Jersey, he invented C++. Stroustrup originally called this new language "C with class" and in 1983 it was renamed C++. C++ extends C by adding object-oriented features. Because C++ is based on C, it includes all the features, attributes, and advantages of C. In this sense, you can think of C++ as the evolution of C. The reason for this evolution is complexity. Once a program's code exceeds 25,000 to 100,000 lines, it is difficult to grasp its complexity as a whole. C++ breaks through this limitation and helps programmers understand and manage larger programs.

Of course, today's C++ is not just as simple as the evolution of C. It also contains many other new content. C++'s evolution to C is mainly on the scale. Almost all the new features of C++ are for large-scale programming. . If C programming is a single-team operation, C++ programming is the group army movement. It's so complicated that you have to spend several times learning C to learn from him. But because of its historical origins with C, all compilers that support C++ can support C, so they are often referred to as C/C++ (most C code can be easily compiled correctly in C++, But there are still a few differences that cause some valid C code to fail in C++ or have different behavior in C++. Standardization has gone through `C++98->C++03->C++TR1->C++11->C++14`

### <a name="c-other"></a>C/C++ and other languages

Java can be summarized in one sentence, it is a simplified cross-platform C++ language (hence the name C++). People who have mastered C++, learning Java is almost a breeze. Java discards the pointers that are easy to cause errors in the C++ language, and replaces them with references. At the same time, it removes the original C++ and the original operator overloading, removes the multiple inheritance features, replaces the interface, and increases the garbage collector function. Different from the general compiled language and interpreted language, Java first compiles the source code into bytecode, and then relies on virtual machines on different platforms to interpret the execution bytecode, thus achieving "one-time compilation and execution everywhere." Cross-platform features. In the early JVM, this reduced the efficiency of Java programs to a certain extent. However, after the release of J2SE1.4.2, Java's running speed has been greatly improved (O(∩\_∩)O\~ which is of course relative).

Perl, Python, Golang, C\# and other languages ​​like this, or in the same grade as C, or at a level with C++, after learning C/C++, it is easy to learn them. In fact, many languages ​​can be called C language after C.

LISP, Scheme is a completely different type of thinking from C. It is called a functional programming language. It has wonderful applications in areas such as artificial intelligence. Interested friends can appreciate it.

### Why study C/C++

The testers do not have to discuss this issue, they have no choice. If we have a choice, why do we learn C language and not others. First of all, because C itself is very good, it is one of the greatest programming languages ​​in the world. Many people believe that the emergence of C language marks the beginning of the era of modern computer language, which successfully integrated the contradictory attributes that have long plagued early languages. The C language is a powerful and efficient structured language that is easy to learn, and it also includes an intangible aspect - it is the programmer's own language. Its design, implementation, and development are done by programmers who are really engaged in programming, reflecting the way in which real-world programming works. Its characteristics are constantly refined, tested, thought, and rethought by people who actually use the language, making the C language a language that programmers like to use.

Today, with the increasing scale of programming, C often encounters collaborative problems, and C++ has become a truly industrial language while maintaining the efficiency of C and achieving the possibility of large-scale collaboration. The excellence of C/C++ made it mainstream. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, C became the mainstream computer programming language and is still widely used today. Today almost all operating systems, most of the application software, more than 90% of large games are written in C / C + +. In areas where running speed and resource usage are critical, such as games, instant control, and embedded systems, it is basically the world of C language embedded assembly language. Today only one language has better performance than C, which is assembly, and the speed of optimized C programs is about 95%-98% of the compilation. But the compilation is basically not used by ordinary people, so in fact C is the fastest language.

The mainstream means rich information. Whether it's the documentation you need to program, the sample code you're learning, or even the interfaces and libraries provided by the platform, the C/C++ language version is the most versatile. Any hardware software company, when he develops a device or software that can be programmed, will inevitably provide interface functions of C/C++ language. Other languages ​​do not necessarily have such advantages. Whether it's computer graphics, encryption or decryption, or other areas of computer programming, C/C++ is simply the Mandarin of the programming world. According to International Data Corporation, C/C++ is the most widely used programming language for developers worldwide. If you really want to join the programming world and don't understand C/C++, it is simply Mission Impossible.

If you still don't understand, I just need to give a small example. Suppose you now have the opportunity to learn a foreign language, investing in time is almost the same, would you choose to learn English, or Swahili? (Swahili is popular in eastern Africa and is the official language of countries such as Kenya and Kenya). Of course, it is not that other languages ​​are not worth learning, existence is reasonable, and the various languages ​​that exist today certainly have the value of their existence. There is no harm in learning more. No one forbids you to learn French and Japanese on the basis of learning English. Moreover, in order to find a job and other practical reasons, it is very normal and necessary to learn other languages. No matter what the past, the present or the future, there is no language under the sun to be a master. The most important thing is that the words "The XXX language is not really a master" is really boring. Learning C / C + +, mainly through his learning programming ideas, the real martial arts master, is it limited to the knife in his hand?

## Python

Although the C/C++ language has so many benefits as mentioned above, it is not perfect, the first Achilles heel is complexity. In order to cope with the ever-growing needs, C++ provides a lot of wonderful syntax to implement a variety of modern programming features, which makes C++ extremely complex. If a programmer boast that you have mastered C++ thoroughly, you can basically conclude that he has not been in contact with C++ for more than half a year. Fortunately, the C language is still not complicated. However, development efficiency is also a fatal injury to C/C++. Because it is too close to the underlying hardware, C/C++ programs can mobilize almost all resources at runtime to achieve the highest performance. But at the same time, C / C + + programmers must be careful to maintain the operating state of the program, a little careless, light file loss & memory leaks, but also crashes or even the entire system hardware and software crash is also possible (most people C When the language is on the machine, I am afraid that the problem of wild pointers will be more or less encountered). The so-called high returns must be accompanied by high risks. This makes development cautious and development efficiency impossible.

For programs with extremely high performance requirements, such as computer games that require a lot of high-speed 3D computing, engineering software for intensive scientific computing, and web pages and database servers that deal with a large number of users, using C++ is the best choice. But for many applications, a little delay can be tolerated. For example, if you want to get the last 100,000 digits of the pi in a project, if we don't care about the difference between 0.25 seconds and 1.25 seconds, we can choose to develop very high efficiency, and the calculation speed is relatively high. Slow other languages ​​to implement. Of all these other languages, the Python language is highly recommended. "Life is too short, I use Python"

The Python language created by founder Guido van Rossum during Christmas 1989 is an object-oriented, literal translation computer programming language and a powerful general-purpose language that has been in development for nearly two decades. Mature and stable. **Python has the richest and most powerful class library in the scripting language, enough to support most everyday applications. ** This language has very simple and clear syntax features, is suitable for a variety of high-level tasks, and can run in almost all operating systems. Python supports a variety of programming paradigms for imperative programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, aspect-oriented programming, and generic programming. Like dynamic languages ​​like Scheme, Ruby, and Perl, Python has garbage collection capabilities that automatically manage memory usage. It is often used as a scripting language for system management tasks and Web programming, but it is also well suited for a variety of high-level tasks.

The Python language has two key features. First of all it is called a clear language. Because its authors are designing it, the general guiding ideology is that ** for a particular problem, as long as there is a best way to solve it. **This is stated in the Python maxim written by Tim Peters (called The Zen of Python): There should be one and better only one obvious way to do it. This is exactly the opposite of the central idea of ​​the Perl language (another feature of the advanced dynamic language) TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It). Another meaning of the Python language is a clear language. Its author intentionally designs a very restrictive grammar**, which makes bad programming habits (for example, the next line of the if statement is not indented to the right) Can not be compiled. This intentionally forces the programmer to develop good programming habits. In short, almost all Python programs look the same, and relatively, people say, where to find a random character, read a Perl program.

The second feature is that it is called glue language. Oh, this is not to say that it will stick your fingers. What it means is that it can glue together modules made in other languages ​​like glue. Many people use Python to make large programs like this: they first make a usable program in Python, and then rewrite the most influential part of the program into a module in C/C++ (when the requirements are met, there is no need at all). replace). Don't worry about the problem of coordination, Python's extensibility is fully qualified, and extensibility can be said to be a feature of Python as a programming language. New built-in modules can be written in C/C++ or other languages, as well as Python interfaces for off-the-shelf C/C++ or other language modules. In this way, we can fully enjoy the efficiency brought by the rapid development of Python, and achieve sufficient performance.

Coupled with the three well-designed data types: heterogeneous lists, tuples, dictionaries, list comprehension from functional linguistics, object introspection, method dynamic generation, and other outstanding features, making it extremely powerful At the same time, the program is quite simple. Think about it, can you change your own code to run it again on the other side while the C program is running? Python can do it easily. For the same function, the required statement to implement in Python may be only one-tenth to one-twentieth of C, and the time required for development (including debugging) is more than one percent.

The Python language is one of the few programming languages ​​that can be called simple and powerful. For non-professional programmers such as engineer accountants, when they need a language to write a program to solve some small problems (such as doing earthwork calculations, analyzing the profit of an investment, batching and renaming some files, etc.), Python is a better choice than the C language. Even for professional programmers, Python is a tool for hand. In short, Python is the language at hand.

Python is widely used as a scripting language, as well as for web development, and for scientific computing - [Python Scientific Computing] (http://book.douban.com/subject/7175280), You can replace the expensive commercial software MATLAB with lightweight Python~ The following figure is the mind map of Python in some related libraries in the Big Data field. The richness of its third-party libraries is evident.

[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming] at MIT Fall 2008 (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and- Programming-fall-2008) There are a lot of content in the course that is implemented in Python. The MIT Open Course official website has a detailed introduction. The video can also be downloaded from VeryCD and some campus BT stations.

## Java

Java has been briefly introduced in the previous section [C/C++ and other language relationships] (#c-other). As one of the mainstream industrial languages, it mainly faces enterprise-level development. The advantage is that there are mature frameworks and communities, and many large companies are using them. In addition, if you want to write Android apps for Android, the mobile operating system with the highest market share, it won't be Java. So, from the perspective of finding a job, it is necessary to be familiar with Java. However, from the perspective of individual combat, Java code is too redundant and cumbersome, not as concise as Python.

## Go

Go is too young compared to the above programming languages. The Go language was developed by Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, and was officially announced in November 2009.

Contrary to Java learning from C++, Go inherits C, why not learn C++ directly? - Because C++ is too complicated... Also remember Ken Thompson? He is the old man in C language! It’s natural for the old man not to kiss his son. In order to write server programs for Google, parallel and distributed are factors that must be considered, and in order to solve this development efficiency problem (C development efficiency is low, C++ is too complicated), Go is born. . Unlike other mainstream programming languages ​​that need to use third-party libraries or develop and implement concurrency, Go will be implemented concurrently at the language level, which is a great blessing for distributed development. In fact, Erlang before Go is also known for supporting concurrency at the language level, but Go's genes have a strong advantage, which makes them develop rapidly. There have been many developers who have moved from Erlang to Go. Some other features of Go can be found in [Go Language Collection] (https://github.com/wonderfo/wonderfogo/wiki).
