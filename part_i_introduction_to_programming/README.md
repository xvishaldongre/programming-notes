# Part I - Introduction to Programming
```

```

This is the first part of the entire "programming notes". First, let's talk about the title - *Introduction To Programming*, Chinese can be translated into *Introduction to Computer Programming FAQ*, as the name suggests, **This section is only ready to discuss the most programming. The most basic part of the bottom layer allows beginners to build their own minimal learning system. 
**So what is the **FAQ** behind the name? 
FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions, which is a FAQ. 
This stuff is usually a technique used by so-called masters, predecessors, and company support to save time and effort in answering a lot of simple repetitions of novices. 
Once completed, it is easy and economical for both the questioning and the asked parties, and it is very effective. It is really a must-have for home murder.

Ok, let's talk nonsense, let's get into the text.
