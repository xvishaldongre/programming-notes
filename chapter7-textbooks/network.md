This section mainly refers to Chen Shuo's experience in network programming learning. I would like to thank you for your support. The original text link and documentation are attached.

## preliminary reading

* Chinese title: [computer network: top-down method] (http://book.douban.com/subject/1391207/), from the application layer to introduce the computer network, the examples are also more vivid, suitable for entry science (think Advice on in-depth study begins directly with Stevens' books. 
The Chinese translation is of good quality. Andrew S. Tanenbaum's *Computer Networks* introduces the computer network from the bottom up. The two books have different styles. I personally recommend James F.Kurose's *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach. *.

* [TCP/IP Illustrated Volumn 1] (http://www.pcvr.nl/tcpip/) - Stevens' classic technical book, a must-read classic for network programming. 
The third edition has a big change (the Stevens is late), the TCP part of the third edition is worthy of attention, the other chapters can read the second edition, and the second edition of the chapters is very old and does not have to be read.

* [TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1: The Protocols] (http://freecomputerbooks.com/TCP-IP-Illustrated-Vol-1-The-Protocols.html) - Additional resource links for the above books.

## Advanced

* [UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1] (http://www.unixnetworkprogramming.com/) - Book website.

* [UNIX Network Programming] (http://book.douban.com/subject/1500149/) - The translation quality is very high.

* [Jon Snader's Home Page] (http://home.netcom.com/~jsnader/) - Introduction and errata of *Effective TCP/IP Programming*. 
This book is a summary of expert experience.

##High order

* [Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects] (http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/POSA/POSA2/) - Summarizes the development of concurrent web service programs, for UNP Very good addition. 
The book emphasizes modularity, business logic and network communication decoupling. 
The code is for reference only, mainly looking at ideas.

* *TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 2: The Implementation* - A big difference from the existing Linux, Chen Shuo's website has a user-mode implementation of Linux. 
Mainly look at the implementation of the TCP part.

## Other supplements

* [TCPIP Network Programming Four Books and Five Books] (../downloads/TCPIP Network Programming Four Books and Five Books.pdf) - A book review written by Meng Yan in the 2003 "Programmer" magazine.

* [Talk about network programming learning experience] (../downloads/LearningNetworkProgramming.pdf) - Chen Shuo wrote, the original link can be seen [Talk about network programming learning experience (06-08 update)] (http://blog .csdn.net/solstice/article/details/6527585). 
The author is still quite experienced in network programming, and has published books [Linux multi-threaded server programming] (http://book.douban.com/subject/20471211/), which has a lot of dry goods.
