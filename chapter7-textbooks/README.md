# Chapter 7 - Textbook Recommendations and Others
```

```

Recommending a good book or online course is certainly one of the important tasks of this book. 
Mainly C/C++, Python, Java, data structure algorithms and other textbooks. 
Let's recommend it to everyone else.

The textbooks of any of these themes are full of enthusiasm and can't be read for a lifetime. 
However, it is clear that the classics that everyone recognizes are just a few of them. The following recommendations are all such works (in fact, they can only be said to be suitable for most people). 
Of course, the book we recommend may not be suitable for you. If there is a better one, you can ask for an issue or send a pull request. 
The textbooks or online courses recommended in this book do not have to be read. You can choose according to your own interests and energy. 
Reading is not an end in itself. It is also because you have to understand, think, and apply.
