### Linux C/C++ programming one-stop learning

Author: Song Jin Shan

I personally like this book, and at the same time it is a "one-stop" learning. Under the Linux, I can learn C/C++ with this book, so I put it in the first book.

The book covers a wide range of topics: C's basic syntax, simple data structures and algorithms, C-assembly links, computer system architecture, operating systems, regular expressions, TCP/IP, and Linux system programming. 
From the latest content on the book's website, the author is adding C++ and dynamic language parts, like!

As a result, it seems that everything is not fine, but it is not the case. 
The author interspersed the content very well and clarified the most important things in each aspect in a very concise way. 
So, in fact, this is the primer, and of course it is suitable for all aspects of the use.

In March of the 11th, the author published "One-Stop Learning C Programming" (upgrade version), which weakened the directionality of Linux and embedded, and also became more suitable for zero-based readers to read in "it and the previous version." The author has such a paragraph: "Although I said in the last edition that this is a book for a completely zero-based reader, the reality has taught me to write a book for any zero-based reader. The books that can be understood are a complex system engineering. I can only try to get close to this goal and never achieve this goal.” Fortunately, this programming guide booklet makes up for this. O(∩\_ ∩)Ohaha~

After leaving the country, the author updates on the original "One-Stop Learning of Linux C Programming" and writes in English and Chinese - [Learning Linux C/C++ Programming from Scratch] (http://songjinshan.com/akabook/) The English version is currently writing the fourth part - [from C to C++] (http://songjinshan.com/akabook/en/index.html). 
The complete old version can be found in [Linux C Programming One-Stop Learning] (http://akaedu.github.io/book/). 
It is rare for a technical writer who is responsible for his own work in China.

### C Programming: A Modern Approach

Author: KN King

Chinese title: [C language programming: modern method (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4279678/)

The book, as its name suggests, modern methods, explains some of the ways to adapt to modern large-scale programming. 
The first edition of the book was used by more than 225 schools, such as MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Caltech, and others. 
The second edition has added a lot of content. Of course, the book is also a lot thicker, many... The contents of the book are clear and the quality of the translation is also very good. It is suitable for self-study textbooks.

### C Primer Plus

Author: Stephen Prata

Chinese title: none

The encyclopedia of C language has both depth and breadth and can be used as a reference book. 
The typical foreign textbooks are very, very thick and thick enough to make you feel like a roar.

The sixth edition has been published abroad and contains an introduction to the latest C11 standard. 
However, at present, C99 is the most common flaw.

The Chinese translation version of the fifth edition of this book is super bad. If you accidentally bought this book, you will be mistaken for the children. If you burn it, it will pollute the environment and use it as waste paper. 
I want to find a way to get an original English version. I won't tell you the specific method.

## Advanced reading

It is best not to read such books before reading the readings, otherwise the mind and body will be greatly devastated.

### The C Programming Language 2nd edition

Author: Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie

Chinese title: [C Programming Language: 2nd Edition • New Edition (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/1139336/)

This book is referred to as K
&
R, written by the creator of the C language, and its quality is unquestionable. 
The writing is very streamlined, but it is not suitable for getting started. It is a pleasure for those who have already had a certain understanding of C.

### C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions 2nd edition

Author: Steve Summit

Chinese title: [You must know 495 C language problems (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/3422332/)

This book is the result of many years of hard work by many participants in the Summit and C FAQ online list, and is one of the most precious treasures in the C language world. 
It is suitable for C to have a certain understanding and certain programming practice. Then I published the second edition of the book in 1995. The Chinese version is the first edition. It was released in 2009, so it has been greatly improved with the original English version.

### Expert C Programming

Author: Peter van der Linden

Chinese title: [C expert programming (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/2377310/), Chinese translator: Xu Bo

Although the content of the book is very deep and covers a wide range, the author's language is humorous and it is not so boring to read.

### Pointers on C

Author: Kenneth Reek

Chinese title: [C and pointer (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/3012360/), Chinese translator: Xu Bo

Ibid., the Chinese translator is still Xu Bo. The translation will occasionally be a bit sloppy. The whole book is organized by the main line of pointers, but the content actually exceeds the scope of pointers and covers many advanced topics of C language.

### C Traps and Pitfalls

Author: Andrew Koenig

Chinese title: [C traps and defects (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/2778632/)

The book is very thin, the original English version was published on January 11, 1989, when the ANSI standard has not yet come out. 
As you can imagine, the defects mentioned in the book have been considerably improved in C89 
&
 C99, so you must understand C89 
&
 C99 before you can absorb the most value. 
Although the book is very old, but the thoughts of it can still be used for reference.

### C: A Reference Manual

Author: Samuel P. Harbison 
&
 Guy L. Steele

Chinese title: [C Language Reference Manual (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/2132084/)

It is suitable for reference when writing programs. For each function, there are detailed differences between C89 
&
 C99.

### The Standard C Library

Author: PJ Plauger

Chinese title: [C Standard Library (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/3775842/)

The original English version was published on January 11, 1991, and the Chinese translation was published in July 2009. 
This book is a succinct description of the use of each library function and implementation details, as well as the complete source code to implement and test these functions.

### Writing Solid Code

Author: Steve Maguire

Chinese title: [Programming Pristine (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/3406939/)

The original English version was published on January 1, 1993. In 2009, the People's Posts and Telecommunications published a Chinese translation version. In 1993, the Electronic Industry Publishing House basically did not.

This book is not long, mainly about the experience of the Microsoft team in the process of developing large software.

### ISO/IEC 9899:1999, Programming languages ​​— C 2nd edition

Chinese title: ISO C99 specification

Everything about the C language, only one thing is the most authoritative, that is the ISO norm. 
But this is not a formal publication, it is a technical description similar to a legal text, and it is only available in English. 
Novice reading, beware of vomiting and death. 
And even if there is an ISO specification, it is not obvious that each compiler will implement it.

PS released the C11 standard a few years ago, and it is estimated that it will take many years to spread.
