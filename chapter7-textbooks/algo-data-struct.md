### The Art of Computer Programming

Author: Donald E. Knuth

Chinese title: Computer programming art, referred to as **TAOCP**, is known as the classic in the classics, every book that everyone who wants to master the essence of the algorithm must read, the Bible in the algorithm book. 
**For the town building, novices should not read it as an introductory book and will vomit blood. 
**

Speaking of this book, I can't help but want to introduce the life of my grandfather.

At the beginning of 1938, Gartner was born in Wisconsin, USA. 
He graduated from the California Institute of Technology and is currently a well-known computer scientist in the United States and an honorary retired professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. 
The full name of Gartner is English: Donald Ervin Knuth. 
His Chinese name was taken before he arrived in China in 1977, and Yao Chufeng took it for him. 
Knuth has since used Gartner as its name in the Unicode world.

TAOCP's multi-volume theory of algorithmic analysis has long been recognized as a definitive description of classical computer science. 
The complete three volumes that have been published so far (the fourth volume has been partially published) have formed the only precious resources of programming theory and practice, and numerous readers have praised the profound influence of Knuth's writings on individuals, and scientists have analyzed them. The beauty and elegance of the marvel, and the practical programmers have successfully applied his "recipe" solution to everyday problems, all of whom are erudite, clear, precise and highly humorous in Knuth's book. And he is extremely admired for him.

He is known worldwide for his achievements and his numerous creative and far-reaching books (19 books, 160 papers). 
Let's just say that none of the computer software that you have ever heard of or are still alive is not directly or indirectly trained by Knuth. 
The degree of his toughness can be explained by only a small matter. In the process of writing this set of "Computer Programming Art", he re-created a new computer typesetting system due to the lack of the original typesetting system. The set of things called TEX is now the standard system in the publishing world.

In 1968, Gartner, who had just entered Stanford, began preparing to publish the classic masterpiece "Computer Programming Art". It was said that he wrote 3,000 pages at a time, and he plans to write seven volumes (four volumes have been completed so far). 
These seven volumes are: basic algorithm, semi-numerical algorithm, sorting and searching, combination algorithm, sentence algorithm, context-free language theory, compiler technology. 
At the end of 1999, the book was listed by the American Journal of Scientists as one of the best 12 academic monographs of the 20th century.

It is recommended to take a close look at the comments on Douban and Amazon or take a look at the printed version. Although many books are highly recommended, they are not necessarily seen by them. Personally, they feel that Chinese translation looks a bit awkward. It is recommended to read English. The original version is good. 
**There is a glimpse of the end of the paper. I know that this matter must be carried out.

### [Introduction to Algorithms - Introduction to Algorithms (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/20432061/)

The algorithmic textbook of the Department of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has become the standard reference book for university textbooks and professionals widely used worldwide. 
The book is very thick and suitable for use as a reference book. It can be combined with MIT course notes and videos. 
After the specific lecture video link, add it.

Both of the above are heavyweight algorithm books, and some lightweight books are recommended below.

### [Algorithms - Algorithm (4th Edition) (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/19952400/)

Robert Sedgewick has written a lot of good books on algorithms. This is his most recent book on algorithm books. He is also the best book reader in all of his algorithm books. It is implemented in Java and has been written in C/. Algorithm book for C++ implementation. 
Coursera divides the book into two parts, [Algorithms, Part I | Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) and [Algorithms, Part II | Coursera] (https:// Www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII), the contents of the book are extremely detailed, the Chinese version has not been seen, but the English original layout is superb!

### [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python] (http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html)

The Python party's welfare, the author published an electronic version for free on the Internet for everyone to read. 
There are not many books written in Python, and there are other good books that can be used to send PR.

Here are some textbooks for writing algorithm books in C/C++.

### [Algorithm: C language implementation (Douban)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4065258/)

The algorithm implementation of C and C++ is an early masterpiece of Robert Sedgewick. Although the name is not as good as the one implemented by Java, if you look at the algorithm book implemented by C or C++, the two are good. 
Robert Sedgewick taught a long time book in Princeton.

**To be improved**

The Online Judge System (OJ) is an online judgment system. 
The user can submit the program source code (such as C, C++, Pascal) online, the system compiles and executes the source code, and verifies the correctness of the program source code through pre-designed test data. 
[2]

Most of OJ's topics are about algorithms. 
The input and output of the title is usually the command line mode, not the graphical interface. 
That is to say, it is not the insignificant details of the compatibility of the platform, the format of the file or the arrangement of the window, but the logical realization of the problem itself.

A user-submitted program will be subject to more stringent restrictions when executed under the Online Judge system, including runtime limits, memory usage limits, and security restrictions. 
The results of the user program execution will be captured and saved by the Online Judge system and then forwarded to a referee. 
The referee program either compares the difference between the output data of the user program and the standard output sample, or verifies whether the output data of the user program satisfies certain logical conditions. 
Finally, the system returns a status to the user: (Accepted, AC), Wrong Answer (WA), Time Limit Exceed (TLE), Output Limit Exceed (OLE), Memory Limit Exceed , MLE), Runtime Error (RE), Format Error (PE), or Compile Error (CE), and return the memory, run time and other information used by the program.

The Online Judge system was originally used in the ACM-ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contest and the Automated Judgment and Ranking in the OI Informatics Olympiad. 
It is widely used in the training of college students' programming in the world, the training and selection of participating players, various programming competitions, and the automatic submission and judgment of data structure and algorithm learning and homework.

The following OJs are very good, please feel free to enter, you can also search for yourself. OJs in many schools in China are in the midst of a booming construction, and some even directly serve as an examination system.

 There is an article on Soso Wikipedia that is well presented, [OJ] (http://baike.soso.com/v708668.htm)

The taste of being alone in a problem is very depressing, especially when you are struggling with your brain. 
Fortunately, there are still many friends who are also doing the same on the Internet. They usually focus on solving problems in forums such as BBS or mailing lists, and even have answers available. 
OI (Olympiad in Informatics Olympics) [3] is recommended for keyword search.

Where can I see the code examples? 
This can be Google yourself. If you can already do some OJ questions, then consider some open source software code. 
Http://sourceforge.net 
<
http://github.com
>
 There are a lot of open source software on 
<
http://code.google.com
>
. It will be rewarded to identify an application theme. 
But to be honest, there is a certain leap from OJ to the project, so it is not easy to find a project that suits you. 
You can try to work with others to do some small projects [4], use it while learning, or find some well-known but relatively small-scale projects, and then find the code of his earlier version, it will be clearer, such as vim1.0 /2.0 lua1.0 apache1.0 this.
