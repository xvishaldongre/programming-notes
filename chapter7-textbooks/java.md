Chinese title: [Java language programming] (http://book.douban.com/subject/6952199/)

A huge book, explaining super detailed, especially the basic algorithm and sorting chapter, very classic!

### Core JavaTM, Volume I–Fundamentals

Chinese title: [Java Core Technology·Volume 1: Basic Knowledge] (http://book.douban.com/subject/25762168/)

Very very basic.

## Advanced reading

### Thinking in Java 4th edition

Author: Bruce Eckel

Chinese title: [Java Programming Ideas (4th Edition)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/2130190/)

The book, as its name suggests, has risen to the level of Thinking, and is suitable for people who have a certain understanding of the language or have a certain computer programming skills. 
This book gives me the feeling of clear explanation without losing depth. 
The Chinese version of the translation quality is OK, although the paper is a little thin, but it seems to be more resistant to flipping, you can buy.

### Core JavaTM, Volume II–Advanced Features

Chinese title: [Java Core Technology (Volume 2): Advanced Features] (http://book.douban.com/subject/25841326/)

### [Effective Java](http://book.douban.com/subject/3998727/)

The books in the Effective series, I will not introduce more, ** advanced use **.

### [In-depth understanding of Java Virtual Machine (2nd Edition)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/24722612/)

The JVM-analyzed classics of Chinese people are not just simple translations of JVM documents, but the details are very good.
