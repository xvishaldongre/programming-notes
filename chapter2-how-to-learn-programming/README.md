# Dropout Programming

I talked about the basic concepts of programming so much, so how do I start learning?

## I heard that programming is difficult, can I learn?

Do you think it is difficult to speak Chinese? Chinese is one of the most difficult languages ​​to learn in the world, but can you not fluently talk to others in Mandarin every day? The difficulty of any kind of computer language will not exceed English, and it is even less than that of Chinese. The difficulty of programming is basically equivalent to the strong man who commands IQ<20. So do you think you can learn to program?

Remember that learning and learning are two levels, just like the gap between middle school students' compositions and newspaper publications. To reach the level of learning, as long as you have the knowledge base of the third grade of elementary school, you can start, that is, literacy. If you want to learn well, you need a cultural level of junior high school graduation, that is, you should understand English and analytic geometry. Of course there is a higher level of technology, for example, at the level of a professional writer, you will be called a professional programmer. And if you are called a master, it is the Nobel Prize in Literature. Of course, it takes a lot of hard work to reach that level.

### My English is very poor, what should I do?

Unavoidable facts, most of the information technology in today's world is the invention of Europeans and Americans. More precisely, it is the credit of Americans. Naturally, all kinds of data and documentation technical manuals, especially those that record the latest technology, are written in American lingua franca or English. There may be no big problems in not knowing English in other fields, but in the IT industry, if you don't understand English, you can't master the most advanced technology, which is basically equal to the day when there is no beginning. Do not understand? - If you don't understand, go check.

But then again, it is not that you must have a high score of TOEFL IELTS to learn programming. For historical reasons, most computer languages ​​borrow some of the English vocabulary as the basic vocabulary, but it does not mean that you must learn English before you can learn programming. As far as programming itself is concerned, the level of English it needs is just a few words of rote memorization. When you watch a Hollywood blockbuster, you can always remember the names of the protagonist and the main supporting role in a film. There are a total of 32 C keywords, and 6 to 7 of them use more than 78%, so you still have What can be worried about. However, in order to become a master, reading a large amount of relevant information is inevitable. At this time, English shows its importance. If you can use the original English software, try not to use the Chinese version. You can read the classic English textbook and try not to read the translated Chinese version. It is not a foreign-style beauty here, but the use of the Chinese version of the software is very easy to cause all kinds of unpredictable problems. The textbooks translated by the Chinese people are more or less unnatural, and a small episode follows:

> If I give up learning programming because of only a handful of English words, I can only say that such people leave early. Incidentally, the author of this article (here, BlueAuris) has always believed that the Chinese programming language called Easy Language is a complete joke. The reason is very simple. Other popular languages ​​have their own unique features. Just like Wudang Jian Shaolin punches a dog stick, it has a place on the rivers and lakes. This language has nothing but a few Chinese identifiers. These Chinese identifiers are just the use of text substitution to replace several specific vocabulary words of C language with the corresponding Chinese. Any text editor can do this. The performance of the image, this is a wretched guy wearing a full set of Arab robes and practicing the whole road, the Shaolin Changquan and then shouting loudly. This is the Middle Eastern oil tycoon box he invented with national characteristics.

## Can I learn programming?

If you have already seen the previous part, you are obviously new to programming. No matter what purpose you are studying for, is it very confident after reading the above words? But I want to hit you, not everyone learns to program well. Everyone learns to drive, but not everyone can go to the track, Schumacher is only one. Just as some thrilling rides prohibit the participation of hypertensive heart disease patients, programming as an intellectual and physical activity requires certain requirements for participants. Let's take a look at it. If you meet the following conditions, you can start with a bold start. :-)

Let me talk about the constitutional requirements. Taizu said: The body is the capital of the revolution. A healthy body is good for programming, but it doesn't mean that people with disabilities can't participate. As far as the current state of the art is concerned, except for cerebral palsy and blindness, other physical disabilities are not hindered at all. The fact that Stephen William Hawking can continue to study in such a serious situation is not enough to motivate you. (^o^)

Followed by enough energy and time. Dear little friend, as long as you can sit still for half an hour and read this booklet quietly, your physical fitness will be up to standard. If you want to tell me that you can operate for more than 18 hours in front of the computer in one day, what I want to say is that the little friend, although you are sharp, please pay attention to protect your body and eyes. As long as you can take 30 minutes to learn programming every day, then your time is also qualified, of course, more time is indeed better, but there is no need for 12 hours a day. Programming is not the most important thing in the world, we have other things to do. It must be recognized that learning programming is important, rather than relying on explosive power, and half an hour a day is much better than six hours a week.

The third requirement is that you have to understand a little computer. Yes, as long as you understand it. Because this is one of the main purposes of this article: to introduce programming to people who understand computers. So, how do you know a little? It's OK to browse the web and enter the code with a text editor and enter the 26 letters and ten numbers on the keyboard.

Finally, you need to have tenacious perseverance. Programming is not as easy as you think, not a picnic or a party. Especially for C++, which professional programmers should master, it can be described in two sentences: three years without opening, and three years of opening. Remember, C++ is called a real programmer's language and there is no reason, its complexity and performance are beyond your imagination. There are countless novice programmers who give up in less than the first month, and you'd better make sure you are not one of them. Perseverance can be measured without a ruler. Here I can only wish you all the best. Good luck~

### Do you have a computer?

So far, yes. In old age, Beethoven can compose music out of thin air without relying on things like piano, but almost no programmers write in the brain without relying on computers, especially at the beginning of learning. But that doesn't mean you can only program on your computer. In the era when computers were still rare electronic products, how many people could program them on a computer very conveniently? But in the end, did not the same birth of many excellent programmers? So how are they programmed? - paper, pen and brain. Of course, having a computer is obviously better.

Programs written in a variety of languages ​​are run on a wide variety of machines and devices, from handheld devices to jumbo servers, from desktop computers to microwave ovens, where all programs that run automatically run. But unfortunately, it's not as long as the device that can be run can be used for programming. It's like the washing machine can make a pleasant sound, but you can't expect to use the washing machine to record popular songs (may... maybe SONY has I reserve the opinion of such products).

Most of the current languages, the computers they need are not as advanced as you might think. Of course, as a learning, we still need a device that is more handy. Yes, the most important thing is to call the two words. The so-called hand is not because of equipment problems, hinder your thinking, does not require high-speed processors, does not require huge displays, and does not require a large number of hard drives. Just call the hand. Of course, if you are a game or audiophile, then you can be nonsense when I say. Programming is not a luxury sea tour, but a practice. There is no need for a five-star hotel for practice, but there is also a need to break the house to shelter from the wind, otherwise it will catch a cold and how to practice it?

## Programming first step

First of all, make sure your health and basic computer operation level (will not? Do not go to school, health is not good? I can only recommend you exercise more).

In the matter of programming, no one can teach without a teacher, and genius does not work. So the first thing you have to do is to find a good introductory textbook, preferably a classic one (which will be introduced later). Repeatedly reading the textbooks, keep in mind that most of the questions you have raised are explained in the textbooks, but you have not looked at them seriously. Read it over and over until you feel that you can write the textbook before you can discard it. One of the reasons why the textbook is better than the teacher is that you can take the textbook to the bathroom and go to the bedroom, but the teacher can't. Of course, the teacher also has a better place than the textbook, that is, he can explain to you the problems that are not in the textbook. But remember that the teacher is also a person, you go to find him without thinking, he will be bored. Don't despise your teacher, even if he is not as good as you are, but at least in programming, he can be your teacher is his hard truth. Respecting the teacher is the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, O(∩\_∩)O haha~

Do you think that you can speak English by reading grammar books and memorizing words without practicing your mouth? Obviously not right. Programming is also true, practice makes it the same everywhere. First of all, read the examples on the textbook, make sure to understand it, and then write it out according to his ideas. When you try it, you will know that understanding and dictation are two completely different degrees. Then you can do the exercises behind the book, think independently, after you think about it, it is best to knock it on the computer, not to have to read the answer or prompt. When you can do the exercises in the back of the book, you are getting started. If your goal is just to get a high score for the exam, you can go to sleep now, but if you want to use programming to solve some practical problems, sorry, you still owe it. The difference is equivalent to the difference between a college English essay and a best-selling English novel.

The exercises behind the book are just the first step in programming. You have a lot of words and familiar grammar and can't let you write beautiful English novels. You have to learn literary skills such as rhetoric and layout, and you must master things like historical allusions, proverbs, and cultural backgrounds. If you want to sell well, you need extraordinary themes, vivid stories and ups and downs. There are just a few similar things in the programming circle, which are left to the next chapter.

## Question to whom to ask

I still remember that Zheng Wei’s "The Long Road" lyrics are:

> Remember that no one will sympathize with you, my dear brother

> You better have the courage to live

> Because the road is long, we have to fight up and down

### Compiler / Interpreter - Case Discovery

Programming this thing, basically can not expect someone to help you, because you are likely to ask others half a day later to find out that the two of you are not a thing at all. When you have problems programming, you should first look at the information provided by the compiler. It is the most direct source, which is equivalent to the crime scene. Few criminal police directly solve the crime without looking at the autopsy report (of course, for Conan I keep silent).

Modern compilers are not only simple to compile, but the compilation itself can send a lot of hints. The debugging function is even more powerful enough to let you see what happens to every step of the program, as long as you can understand it. The problem of the machine should be solved by the machine, not by the naked eye (before you have not practiced it). But don't rely too much on the compiler, especially when you are learning to start programming. When you have an error, you can use the brain to run the program on the paper. You can't make a single step. If you try a few times, your programming ability will naturally be very high. Great improvement.

### Teaching materials and documents - tools at hand

The textbooks and documentation at hand can solve more than 70% of the problems. The manual under [Linux] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is very good, and some IDE help files are also good. If it is not enough, go online and check. If you can't find it, remember that there is something called a search engine.

### Search Engine - Second Brain

In today's era of knowledge explosion, massive amounts of information are stored on the Internet, so how do you filter out the information you need from this vast amount of information? - Answer the search engine. The first [Google] (https://www.google.com), if used properly, most problems can be solved. Search engines are good for solving a single point of problem, and the next recommended [Wikipedia] (http://zh.wikipedia.org) is more suitable for solving a single problem. Wikipedia pages tend to have some of the corresponding topics below. Links and other topics in the same category are introduced. After the detailed introduction of the efficient use of search engines, here is the first thing to know about a search engine.

### Asking for help from others

If none of the above three methods can solve your problem and confirm that you have worked hard and have no answer, then you can ask the teacher, classmates or ask questions on the mailing list. Before you are sure to ask questions, please [How To Ask Questions the Smart Way] (http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Essays/smart-questions.html) [[1]](#ref1) [[2 ]](#ref2) [[3]](#ref3) Read it out. After you have solved a problem, you can record it on your blog or wiki. Lele is not as good as it is. :)
