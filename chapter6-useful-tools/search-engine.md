# Efficient use of search engines
```

```
Take Google as an example here. Other search engines are far from each other, not to mention.

In order to improve the efficiency of search, Goolge officially even arranged a series of courses to teach you to better use their home search function. [Search Education â€“ Google] (http://www.google.com/insidesearch/searcheducation/index.html), here's a more general example of how to improve search efficiency

### Picking the right search terms

#### What Matters in a Query?

1. Every word matters - every keyword is important
2. Order matters - different keyword search results are different
3. Capitalization does not matter - the letter case does not affect
4. Punctuation does not matter - Punctuation does not affect (except special characters, such as C++, C#)
5.


1. Identify unique keywords
2.


#### Site Search

#### Specify file suffix name
