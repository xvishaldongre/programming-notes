# How to find a good book
```

```

This is a very good question and we should share it with the readers. 
** It is better to teach fish than to teach it. 
**The world publishes a variety of different books every day, and we can't have so much time to pick one. 
In general, classic books must be able to stand the test of everyone.

Among the publishers that publish more electronic textbooks in China, there are People's Posts and Telecommunications Publishing House, Electronic Industry Press, Tsinghua University Press, and Machinery Industry Press. These four publishers are more likely to have good books, but It does not mean that all are good books. 
Foreign Addison Wesley, Microsoft Press, McGraw Hill, Pearson 
&
 O'Reilly are also the places to make a lot of books, such as Addison Wesley, Pearson, McGraw Hill, and other other classics such as mathematics and electronics. The books of the three publishers can be seen everywhere.

The above is to pick from a large scope, the book is written by people, and the quality of the book is largely determined by the editor's level, so to find a better book in a certain field, you can first find out which leaders in this field. Character, go and see what books he has written.

Today's network is very developed, and information is getting easier. Just like the domestic [Douban] (http://www.douban.com), it is very good in books and movie reviews. There are many circles and The group is for you to check. If it is a good book, there will be more comments on it. We can make a choice based on the ratings and comments above.

The two book review websites I generally focus on:

1. [Douban Reading] (http://book.douban.com/), Douban is not only a gathering place for young artists, but also a place where many science and technology men often go, such as me...

2. [Amazon] (http://www.amazon.com), it is the Amazon that is abroad, but it is not the domestic Amazon. The book review on the domestic Amazon is not very informative.

In addition to the evaluation of a single book, there are some well-organized beans on the watercress, which are often built on a theme.

## How to download the book "Sample"

Although it is safer to judge a book by third-party evaluation, sometimes there are some books that can't be found for third-party evaluation. At this time, you need to rely on your own eyes!

Books in Amazon/Amazon and [Google Books] (http://books.google.com/) can usually see some sample chapters, and we can roughly judge the value of this book through the sample chapter. 
If it is a student party, the school library is a good library. Let's go to the field and do not charge memory.

We often encounter this situation in the library. The books are arranged one after another, but there are not many that can be seen. 
In the few books that can be seen, most of them are borrowed, and some bad sluts are often borrowed. 
At this time, if you want to read the favorite books, you can generally divide them into two channels: buy them from e-commerce and download them online. 
For the poor student party, I think most people will choose the latter... This is the reason why the Title sample is quoted, oh, although the following provides some "small tricks" for everyone to see. Good textbooks, but still want to appeal to everyone to support the efforts and copyright of the original author. A good textbook requires the author to pay a lot of energy.

Recently, it is getting harder and harder to download copyrighted books. The public sharing of major domestic network disks has been stopped. The situation is getting more and more serious, but there are still some fish missing.

* The [Computer Zone] (http://club.topsage.com/forum.php?gid=2) of the domestic guest forum has a high-definition photocopy of many classic textbooks.

* [Library Genesis] (http://libgen.org/), http://gen.lib.rus.ec, http://free-books.us.to, http://ebookfi.org, http: //libgen.info, http://bookos.org/ Some of the original English textbooks that can't be downloaded can be downloaded here. The disadvantage is that the speed is very slow. It may be better with foreign VPS.

* [Online Library] (http://english.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=31171
&
ParentID=1989
&
Language=3) - Some classic foreign language books can be read online.

* [Web search, disk search] (http://www.pansou.com/), integrated the file index of many domestic and foreign network disk, it is simply mad!

* ~~[皮皮书屋](http://www.ppurl.com/)~~, there are many good e-books. 
**The website is now closed. 
**

* [mLook Elected E-book] (http://mlook.mobi/), there are Douban plug-ins, there are many high-quality e-books inside, many of them are Kindle-friendly mobi format. 
However, it has now closed public registration.

* Use Google's in-site search and file extensions to lock targets faster.
