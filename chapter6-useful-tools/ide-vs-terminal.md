## Programming Toolchain

If a worker wants to do something good, he must first sharpen his tools. 
Here are some efficient tools recommended for the programming toolchain.

### IDE vs Terminal

* * * * *

To be integrated

I have talked so much about programming before, so how do you turn your ideas into final results? 
- Of course, choose the right compiler (or something similar), the first push GCC\#, the compiler is not introduced here, the preliminary explanation has been done before, beginners do not need to waste too much time here. , knowing that it can translate your code into a computer executable file is OK. 
Let's take a look at C/C++ below, and other languages ​​are similar.

As for the C language teaching in colleges and universities in China, the VC6.0 usage rate under Windows is still relatively wide. It is estimated that most of them use pirated Chinese software. When I started learning, the teacher also used VC6.0 to demonstrate in class. Demonstration, I have to protest here a little, beginner programming completely without VC6.0 (compatibility in Win7 is very problematic) and even such a huge thing like Visual Studio, light construction project configuration file can hit a lot of newcomers' self-confidence And the inexplicable mistakes are often there! 
For beginners, I personally feel that Linux + Terminal is very good, and it can be more perfect with "Linux C One-Stop Programming".

If you like IDE, it doesn't matter, free open source [

::Blocks Code::Blocks], free and compact [Dev-C++] (http:// zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev-C%2B%2B) Also good, if you usually use multiple languages ​​to develop, open source Eclipse is not allowed. 
Of course, if you love Windows, Visual Studio is more suitable for you. You can use the free Express version at the beginning of the course, or you can use the Professional version authorized by Microsoft to authorize college students.

Also worth mentioning is software debugging, this is a big topic, the use of gdb in "Linux C One-Stop Programming" has been very detailed, interested to see, other IDEs are more or less For similar troubleshooting features, see the software help documentation or the tutorials on the web.

In addition to the IDE development method, you can also use the Text Editor mentioned above with the compiler. When configured, it is very convenient and efficient.
