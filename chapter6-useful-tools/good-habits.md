### coding style

The code style is good. Just like a word is not good to read. If a company recruits a secretary, it must not be ugly. Similarly, programmers with poor code styles are certainly incompetent. 
Although the compiler won't pick up the ugly code, it can still be compiled, but you can't stand it with other Team programmers. You can't stand it yourself. After you write the code for a few days, you don't know what you wrote. What is it. 
Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. The code is mainly for writing to people, not for the machine to see, but by the way, it can be executed by the machine, if it is for writing Just look at the machine and write the machine instructions directly. There is no need to use a high-level language. 
The code is the same as the language and text to express ideas and record information, so it must be clearly and neatly written to be effective. 
Because of this, in a software project, the code style is generally stipulated by the document, and all the people involved in the project should follow the unified style regardless of their own style.
