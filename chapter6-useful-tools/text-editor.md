In the festival [will not break Coding? 
] (../chapter3-advanced-programming-part1/README.html#sec-coding) mentioned: "Once the algorithm (pseudo code) is fully described, programming is just a job of typing proofreading." Very efficient, then can the work of "typing proofreading" also have some better ways to improve efficiency? 
The answer is yes! 
Some clever programmers have long thought of ways to improve the efficiency of Coding, one of which is to choose a high-performance Text Editor (used to enter the program code, called a text editor).

The most common thing about everyone under Windows is the Notepad program, which is small enough, but I think there should be few people who are willing to use this stuff all the time. 
It doesn't seem to have any reaction when you enter a few lines of code. The code is not highlighted. 
The most common thing under Linux is nano. 
However, compared to the two great gods who are going to play next, I am afraid they have to stand aside, OK, it is the turn of Vim and Emacs.

* Vim-the god of editors

* Emacs-the god's editor

## Vim-Vi IMproved

Vim is a text editor developed from vi. 
Code-ready, compile, error-jumping and other convenient programming features are particularly rich and widely used by programmers. 
It may be slow to start learning, but once you master some basic operations, you can greatly improve your editing efficiency. 
The [Vim Series Tutorial] (http://coolshell.cn/tag/vim) written by the left ear mouse is very good. 
Among them, the non-[Concise Vim Leveling Raiders] (http://coolshell.cn/articles/5426.html) is the most suitable for getting started. 
Place a [VIM Quick Checker for the programmer] (http://coolshell.cn/articles/5479.html#more-5479).

Finally, I recommend BeiYuu's [VIM incomplete use tutorial for Git era] (http://beiyuu.com/git-vim-tutorial/), and using Vundle to manage the Vim plugin is too pleasant.

## Emacs-Editor MACroS

Emacs, the Editor MACroS (Macro Editor), is a text editor that is popular among programmers and other computer users who work primarily on technology. 
Since I am not an Emacs user, the related introductory tutorials are also invited to the Emacs party to add...

## Sublime Text

In addition to the above two artifacts, a new generation of artifacts has emerged in recent years - [Sublime Text: The text editor you'll fall in love with] (http://www.sublimetext.com/). 
Simple and beautiful, easy to get started, third-party plug-ins are also very rich! 
I think the Vim and Emacs learning curve is too shaken to try this sexy editor, but whispered that this editor is commercial software, although it can be used for free.
